What is Kubernetes?

Open-source container orchestration Platform.
It is created to design and atomate process of deployment, scaling and managment of your 
containres.

Problem: manage multiple containers between multiple environments.

manage self healing: auto restrat or replace and reschedule if any container fails
load balancing: distribute traffic and provide high level of availability
manage secret and configuration management

You can solve this entire Problem using Kubernets.

Kubernetes Components
------------------------------
1. Master Node: 
    managing the entire cluster
    It handles all scheduling, all nodes
    manages state management and doing all updates
2. Worker Node:
    Actual application workload runn
    running here in the form of Pods
3. Pod: 
    --very smallest deployable unit
    --inside one pod we can run multiple containers
    --make sure this containers are associated with each other
    --let's say you have application which is using DB container, backend container, frontend
    container you can run them toggether under the one pod
    -- they can share resources commonly
4. API Server: communicating a hub between users and clusters
5. Controller Manager:
    maintain cluster 
    maintain replicasets, load balancing
    maintain diffrent tasks

6. Scheduler: assigns a pods to nodes based on requirement resources.
7. ETCD: storage , storing cluster info in key value pair
8. Kubectl: agent which is running on each worker node to keep your container in expected state.
9. Kube-proxy: managing the networking for all your K8s service.
