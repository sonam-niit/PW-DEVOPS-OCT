Pod
------------
smalles unit of deployment in kubernetes cluster
inside a pod we can run one or more containers

Pods we can create using yml file and we can also create them directly using command as well.

************* Pods using commands **************

>kubectl run nginx-pod --image=nginx --restart=Never

kubectl run :: used to create pods
nginx-pod :: name of a pod
--image=nginx :: showing the image to run in container
--restart=Never :: assure not to restart means its just a pod not deployment

>kubect get pods
(if it is not in a running state)
>kubect describe pod nginx-pod (check the events steps)
>kubect get pods (pod must be in a running state)

If you wnat to access the pod, you have to expose it as service
> kubectl expose pod nginx-pod --type=NodePort --port=80

--type=NodePort : makes service accesible from outside the cluster
--port=80 :: specifying the port on which your service will be available

Verify running Service: kubectl get svc
To access service using minikube
>minikube service nginx-pod
(you will be redirected in browser where you can default page of nginx)
