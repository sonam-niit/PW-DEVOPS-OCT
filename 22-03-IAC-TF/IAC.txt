IAC- Infra as  Code
-------------------------------------

You want to setup the entire infrastructure using some Code rather than doing manual set UP.

Let's say you are working with multiple Providers (aws, azure, gcp)
then we can use IAC.

If you want to manage and provision of servers, networks, storages and
databases automatically rather than manual process use IAC.

****************Types of IAC***************

1. Configuration Management:
    -- manage software installation then use Ansible, chef or puppet

2. Orchestration and Provisioning
    -- Resource Creation  and manage multiple cloud Providers
    -- Terraform

3. Container Orchestration:
    -- Docker and K8s
