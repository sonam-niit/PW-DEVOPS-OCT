Cloud front
------------------
CDN: content delivery network tool
using that we can deliver our contents
APIs, static websites, video steaming etc..

Faster speed.

edge based data fetching
proving caching feature
response provided from the cache

let's create one S3 bucket
------------------------------------
create bucket: sonam-cloud-front-example-1
enable versions
uncheck on block Public access
other option keep as default

upload 3 files which i have shared.
bucket properties --> scroll last --> static site hosting
enable it --> add index.html
when you save it scroll down again check the provided link to access

if permission blocked --> go to permission set policy --> edit
try to generate policy using policy generator
select: s3 bucket policy
priciple: *, action: get Object
arn: give bucket arn number with /* (giving permission to all bucket object)

save and check that link again
--------------------------------------------------------------
to provide output as CDN using cloud front
go to the cloud front
create distribution: bucket-endpoint name, other configuration keep as it is, 
viewer policy use https only, Firewall: not add any security option
save --> create distribution --> once its done
check the deployment status and try to access with the provide domain name:
it looks: https://dp6xfco23ya1f.cloudfront.net/

Right now its accessible through domain name and also from that direct endpoint
I wnat to change the policy to access content only from cloud front and not all.

Try to set policy with condition to provide access from cloudfront but not for all

Principal: "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
condition: stringEnqual, sourceArn : enter arn value for cloudfront distribution
