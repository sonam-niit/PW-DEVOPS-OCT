create below mentioned code structure
    folder backend:
        config.py
        database.py
        models.py
        routes.py
        app.py
        dependencies.py
        Dockerfile

    docker-compose.yml 
    (config file for setting up containerize app)

Terminal: docker-compose up -d --build
it will cretae network, mysql and backend container 
> docker ps
> docker logs container-name
To verify DB container
>docker exec -it mysql_container bash
    # mysql -u root -p (enter password)
        > show databases;
        > use flaskapp;
        > show tables;
    (use exit to exit)

-- If Both containers running then Let's test APIs
in VS Code: ctrl+shift+X (to open extention)
install thunder-client (once installed you can see symbol of thunder client in left side panel)
    
click on new request
-- http://localhost:5000/createtable (get method send)
-- http://localhost:5000/users (get method send)
-- http://localhost:5000/users (POST method)
    click on body:
        {
            "name":"alex",
            "email":"alex@gmail.com"
        }

    then send

    (again check get method and you can see inserted records)

    If you want to connect bash from docker desktop
    go to desktop check running container
        click in mysql_container
        click on 4th tab (exec)

        from that terminal also you can directly access container


-- If you want to stop all your services then
    docker-compose down


    ( you can create react app then use this apis links and connect frontend with backend
    then create dockerfile for frontend also and in compose file create one more frontend,
    after that it will start 3 services 1 by 1 like DB, backend and then fronend
    )
