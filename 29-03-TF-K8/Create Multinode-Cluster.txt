minikube start --nodes=3 -p multinode-cluster

--nodes to give no of nodes
-p multinode-cluster (profile)

Incase if you are getting any error due to existing minikube cluster use below command

	minikube delete
	minikube delete -p multinode-cluster

(after deleting this also getting error of configuration file then)
 go to C drive--> Users--> user-name--> .minikube --> machines --> delete all content from here

After that re run the command

If everything goes well then check cluster

> minikube status -p multinode-cluster

> minikube get nodes

	( 2 can see 1 control-plane and 2 worker nodes)
