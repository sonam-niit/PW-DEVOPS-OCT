to manage your TF resources you can use.
structure your TF project

project 
    module1
        main.tf 
        outputs.tf
        variables.tf
    module2
        main.tf 
        outputs.tf
        variables.tf
    main.tf
    outputs.tf
    variables.tf

Structure of project after using modules

Remote Backend

by default when we are working with Tf it uses local backend.
it creates terraform.tfstate file which is stored locally.

for managing remote backend we can create one resource like s3 bucket and 
we can use tfstate file from bucket rather than using local one.
