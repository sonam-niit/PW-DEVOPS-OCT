Docker Network
-----------------------
we can create network under that containers can communicate with each other.

docker network create network_name
>docker network create test_network
Let's Verify:
>docker network ls
>docker network inspect test_network
Now let's create container under this network
    >docker run -d --name container1 -p 8080:80 --network test_network nginx
    now if you inspect network again you can see the container running under the network
    Let's create 1 more conatiner
    >docker run -d --name container2 -p 8081:80 --network test_network nginx
    Let's Communicate between them

>docker exec -it container1 bash
(we want to run ping command so let's install it)
>apt update
>apt install iputils-ping
>ping container2
>stop by ctrl+c and then exit
(if you can see the packet transfer means they are communicating)

now create one container without giving network details and try to ping
>docker run -d --name container3 -p 8082:80 nginx
now again get into container1 and ping container3, nothing will happen but again try to
ping container2 you can see the packet transfer. Means containers can communicate only
if they are under same network.
