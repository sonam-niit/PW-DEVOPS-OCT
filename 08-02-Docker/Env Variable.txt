Let's Create Simple Nodejs Application
create folder Backendproject
                folder app 
                    create package.json (npm init -y)
                    install dependencies (npm i express dotend)
                    create server.js file
                    create Dockerfile
                create .env file (for environment variable)
                docker-compose.yml file (using app as service)

First time: Compose file
services:
  web:
    build: ./app
    ports:
      - "${PORT}:4000"
    environment:
      - PORT=${PORT}

It will use .env port num which is 4000
the let's up the service:
    >docker-compose up -d --build
    (it will create image first then up your service you can verify the container name)
    >docker ps
    >localhost:4000 (you can see server response)

If you want to scale up let's change compose file to take random ports

    services:
        web:
            build: ./app
            ports:
            - "0:4000"
            environment:
            - PORT=${PORT}

    >docker-compose up -d --build --scale web=3
    (scale web service 3 replicas)
    >docker ps (you can see 3 containers up)

    to stop then no need to manual procee
    >docker-compose down
